<h1>Node Capstone: Tenant Tracker</h1>

<h2>Setup</h2>
Using an API with Create, Read, Update and Delete capabilities, this app will allow those involved in Real Estate/Property Management to enter and track tenant information. The information that is featured in the tenant profile is quick reference information - that which can change often and landlords/managers need to look up quickly.

<h3>Create & Read</h3>
All tenants are automatically listed with drop down menus in the center of the page. To add a new tenant, enter a first and last name and click Submit. The new tenant will be automatically added to the tenant list.
